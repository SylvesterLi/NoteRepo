# Update at 2018/9/14

Fisrt step has been finished and now we shold do is Thinking of Lon-Term Development Plan.

Hexo is working well just as I expect. 

The problem is this hexo is working on ` Azure Virtual Machine Windows Server 2016 ` We could merge wechat dev  enviorment and hexo.

It's convent for us to debug ( wish wechat MP allows us such domian ).
